# ML_Algorithms_from_scratch

This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning algorithms from scratch using python. The purpose of this repository is to understand the working of machine learning algorithms and to get a better understanding of the mathematics behind the algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression

## Next two to in the queue to be implemented

1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision Trees
